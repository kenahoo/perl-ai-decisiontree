Revision history for Perl extension AI::DecisionTree.

0.03

 - Added a 'prune' parameter to new(), which controls whether the tree
   will be pruned after training.  This is usually a good idea, so the
   default is to prune.  Currently we prune using a simple
   minimum-description-length criterion.

 - The list of instances is now deleted after training, since it's no
   longer needed.

 - Small speedup to the train() method, achieved by less copying of data.

 - If get_result() is called in a list context, it now returns a list
   containing the assigned result, a "confidence" score (tentative,
   subject to change), and the tree depth of the leaf this instance
   ended up at.

 - Internally, each node in the tree now contains information about
   how many training examples contributed to training this node, and
   what the distribution of their classes was.

 - Added an as_graphviz() method, which will help visualize trees.
   They're not terribly pretty graphviz objects yet, but they're
   visual.

 - Added support for noisy data, currently by picking the best (most
   common) result when noise is encountered.  See the 'noise_mode'
   parameter to new().

 - Added the rule_tree() method, which returns a data structure
   representing the tree. [James Smith]

 - Significantly sped up the train() method, especially for large data
   sets.

 - The get_result() method is no longer implemented recursively, which
   simplifies it and speeds it up.

 - Reformatted the documentation and added a TO DO section.

 - Documented the nodes() method.
